# BEP20_Modified_From_OpenZeppelin

This project contains a template for the BEP20 token standard for binance smart chain that has been created using the OpenZeppelin ERC20 and Ownable. 

Also included is an interface for BEP20 that contains the additional getOwner() method. 

Most of this code is from OpenZeppelin, credit goes there, this is a quick combination of them to make a template to make BEP20 tokens from.

Written so I could test on solidity ^0.7.5, change the solidity version in files to make it work with future versions if this repo isnt updated.
